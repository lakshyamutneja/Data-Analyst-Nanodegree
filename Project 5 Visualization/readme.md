## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 113,937 loans granted by Prosper, including Prosper score or borrower risk, listing category or loan type, employment status, number of current credit lines, number of open revolving accounts, debt to income ratio, and original loan amount. The dataset can be found in Udacity's

repository [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv),

with variable information available[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0).

  
  
  
  

## Summary of Findings

  

In the exploration, I found several interesting relationships between the dependent variable (LoanSatus) and these selected borrowers features: Prosper score or borrower risk, original loan amount, and debt to income ratio. I choose to present only the loan statuses distribution and its relationship with the variables listed above, but debt to income ratio. The reason for my decision was to improve the storytelling follow and generate meaningful insights.

Some of major insights are as follows:

  1) For Applicants with prosper ratings from AA to D have the higher loan amount with increased salary

2) Employed and full time employees have their mean salaries in higher range

3) Majority of the borrowers are under prosper rating of B.

4) The monthly income of borrowers are having higher values for employed, other and full time employment status with the prosper rating of AA, A and B

5) We observe that homeowner is safest bet when gving a loan. We also observed that HR prosper rating applicants have higher interest rates

> From all above we can see that this analysis , I say that the loan approval status is heavily dependent on the applicant's information on IncomeRange, Homeownerstatus and employment status.

  


  
  

## Key Insights for Presentation

  

For the presentation, I focused mainly with the features that are impactful for approval of loanstatus. I start by introducing the loan status variable, followed by its relationship with borrowers risk (ProsperScore) and the original loan amount.

To analyze the relationships mentioned above, I decided to use box plots,heat maps and bar graphs because they provide all the statistical information and visualization information required throughout this project.



  
 >To conclude this presentation , I will strongly agree with a fact obtained that loan approval status is heavily dependent on the applicant's information on IncomeRange, Homeownerstatus and employment status.
